The 'test' folder holds all of the JUnit tests that were created to test the program.

The 'dist' folder holds the compiled .jar and a folder title 'lib' which contains the necessary libraries to run the compiled code.

The 'src' folder contains all of the Java source code.

The UserGuide.txt contains the compile, run, and test instructions copied over from the Project Report.

Our GitHub repository can be found at: https://github.com/miro2005/CS462-Project
Here you can find all commits, all source code, and all test code that is also included here.
Also, the repository is set up using Netbeans, so one can download the repository folder and have a Netbeans project folder ready to go. (NewGenPOS folder)

We included 3 different file types for our project report. "CPSC462_Project_Report.pdf" was included to preserve the formatting of the report. (.doc does not preserve formatting well when done using Google Docs). "CPSC462_Project_Report.odt" was included because it can be opened in MS word and typically preserves formmating better than .doc.  Lastly, "CPSC462_Project_Report.doc" was included as required.

Lastly, we also included our presentation as "CPSC462_Project_Presentation.pdf"
